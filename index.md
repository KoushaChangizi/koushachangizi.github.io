# Kousha Changizi

**PhD Student in Machine Learning, UC Irvine (Advisor: Pierre Baldi)**  
I build ML systems for scientific data—computer vision for biomedical imaging, circadian transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration. I like turning messy, real-world datasets into models that actually ship and answer scientific questions.

## About

I started my PhD in **September 2022** and expect to graduate by **June 2027**. My research spans **deep learning** and **computer vision** applied to **biology and medicine**—from histopathology segmentation to modeling circadian rhythms and integrating single-cell/multi-omics data.  
Before UCI, I worked at the **Salk Institute** (MyCircadianClock), building end-to-end ML pipelines on large, real-world datasets.

I’m currently open to **Summer 2026** ML/AI research or engineering internships (Menlo Park, Seattle, NYC, Mountain View).
